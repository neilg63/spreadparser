They pick up on the movement of your hands in front of them and make a sound. One hand controls the volume, and the other controls the pitch, or note, you play.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The theremin was invented around 1920, making it the first electronic instrument. It was invented by a Russian scientist called Leon Theremin, and at first he wasn't even trying to make a musical instrument at all![BREAKPARAGRAPH]The theremin became a very popular instrument for creating an eerie, spooky sound. It was used on lots of soundtracks for TV programs and films about monsters, aliens and ghosts, including the theme music for Doctor Who! Did you think the theremin sounded spooky?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The musician who made this recording is called Nick Franglen.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Nick actually performed this piece of music underneath London Bridge. As well as the theremin, he used computers and effects to change the sounds. There were also sensors on the bridge that changed the sound when people walked past. Can you imagine how the sound might change at different times of the day?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Why do you think the piece might be called 'hymn' to London Bridge?",

Poppy Ackroyd is a musician who uses pianos and violins in unusual ways to create lots of unexpected sounds.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This music mixes together recordings of different musical instruments with the sound of clicking pebbles and washing water on Brighton beach.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]When you listened, did you hear how some sounds were short and spiky, whilst others were long and smooth? Perhaps you noticed how the longer sounds gradually got louder and softer, like rolling waves, and the spiky sounds were like little sparkles of light reflecting off the water. What did the sounds make you imagine?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This minute had a lot of reverb, which is a kind of echoing effect that can be used in sound recordings. Did you hear how the sounds bounced around gently from one side to the other? How did the music in this minute make you feel?",

The fingers on one hand pluck the string, while fingers and a thumb on the other hand stop it vibrating to change the pitch and make the sound higher or lower. Could you hear the sounds made by the earth bow? There were also some unpitched percussion sounds accompanying the earth bow, could you hear those too? You could try and recreate the sound using elastic bands![BREAKPARAGRAPH]At the end of the minute you can hear laughter as Sumbu snaps the bow.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]In the background of the recording you may have heard sounds of insects from the rainforest where the BayAka live.

This music goes with a country dance that is also called the 'Boscastle Breakdown'. The simple beat matches the steps of the dancers. Each phrase is 8 beats long and the dancers would perform a different sequence of steps (turns, movemets etc) to each phrase.

The children thought about the sounds that are special to the place where they live. They learned how to make recordings of these sounds and then edited them together. The piece you heard was made by the class from the recordings they made. The sonic postcard is meant to give other people an idea of a place through the way it sounds.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The two schools are in the countryside by the sea, near a place called St Abbs Head in Scotland.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]In May and June every year, thousands of birds come to make their nests and lay their eggs on the cliffs at St Abbs. These include birds called kittiwakes, guillemots, fulmars, razorbills and herring gulls. All these birds have calls which sound very different. The children went on a trip to the cliffs and beach to make some recordings. Which sounds do you think came from their trip?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]When they came back to the classroom, the children tried to re-create some of the sounds they heard using their voices and objects in the classroom. Could you recognise which sounds were made in the classroom?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The high-pitched squeak you heard was meant to sound like a bird call, but was in fact made by a pen on a whiteboard! Did you guess that it was not a natural sound?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The children put their recordings together to make a 'soundscape'. A soundscape is like a picture of a landscape, but made with layers of sounds. Can you imagine what St Abbs looks like from listening to the Sonic Postcard? Try thinking about the place where you live. What sounds do you hear there? What sounds would you describe to someone who has never been there before?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Find out how to make your own Sonic Postcard.

What would your voice sound like if it was stretched like this?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The artist who did this is called Duncan Chapman. Duncan wanted people to think about the timbres and textures, rather than the melody or rhythm of the music.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Tchaikovsky wrote Swan Lake in 1875.

They are small furry mammals that come out to feed on insects at night.  When they are flying fast, bats make a very high-pitched squeak. The sound bounces off objects and comes back to the bat's ears. The bat can tell how far away an object is by how long it takes for the sound to come back. This is called 'echo-location' and stops the bat from bumping into things in the dark! They also use it to catch the insects they eat.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The sound bats make is so high-pitched that humans can't hear it.  This recording has been slowed down many times so that you can hear it at a much lower pitch. Other animals that echo-locate include some whales and dolphins.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Can you think of ways that you use sound to learn about things around you. Can you think of any games that use sound instead of sight?",

A phonograph or gramophone is the earliest kind of record player from the late 1800s.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]One of the most interesting instruments used in this recording is a Stroh violin. It's a bit like a normal violin, but with a metal horn attached to make the sound louder so it could be heard on the recording! It was used in early recordings before microphones were invented.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This recording was made in 2002, but the wax cylinder makes it sound very old! Did you think it was an old recording?

It was a lively, instrumental song made to dance to. The recording we just heard, called 'The Candlelight Fisherman,' shows a different side of folk music: the singer is telling us a little story with his song! Could you understand what he was singing about?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]It's about a fisherman who uses a candle \\\"just to see how the wind do blow.\\\" If the candle blows out, it's too windy for him to go fishing and he stays at home. If the candle doesn't blow out, it's not windy enough for him to go fishing, and he still stays at home. His trick with the candle means he never has to go fishing at all![BREAKPARAGRAPH]There are lots of folk songs about fishing, the sea and sailing on boats. The singer on this recording was called Bob Roberts, who worked all along the River Thames on a barge - a flat bottomed boat used for carrying all sorts of cargo, like coal. He learned many songs from people working on his boat and along the river. Folk songs get passed from person to person just like that, until we forget who even wrote the song! Try listening again. This time, pay attention to the structure of each verse - the final two phrases of each verse are always the same! Maybe that will help you learn a verse of 'The Candlelight Fisherman'?",

These vibrations are transmitted through the guitar and the air inside it vibrates too - this is what makes the sound.  The hollow body of the guitar makes the sound louder - it's an 'amplifier'. The sound then travels through the air to your ears![BREAKPARAGRAPH]Could you hear how his playing changes during the Minute? He starts the piece by plucking one guitar string after another with his fingertips. As he prepares to sing, he starts 'strumming' all the strings together, creating a rhythm to accompany his song. Try tapping along to this rhythm. How did it make you feel?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The performer is called Francis Ouma. He is singing to his brother, asking him not to lose touch with the village where he grew up.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The language he is singing in Swahili.

A bass flute looks different from a normal flute because it has a J-shaped head joint; if it was one, long, straight instrument, it would be too long for the player to reach all the keys! A bass flute is played by blowing across the hole at the top of the instrument. Becuase it is bigger than a normal flute, it makes notes that are lower in pitch and has a very deep, warm sound.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]In this recording, the bass flute plays only one note - C. The different pitches (high and low notes) you can hear are called 'overtones'. These are made by blowing the flute in different ways.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]'Overtones' happen naturally in all sounds. Although you can hear a few different pitches in this piece, they were all made while the player's fingers stayed in the same place.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Electronic 'reverb' has also been added to this recording.

Did you think it sounded like some kind of machine, or a person breathing?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]In fact you heard 10 people with cardboard coffee cups, moving them around on different surfaces to make different sounds! This is part of a 'composition' written by the composer James Saunders. When this piece is performed, each person uses a set of strict instructions about when and how they should move their cup.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The composer, James Saunders, says: 'I am interested in the way ordinary objects can be used to make sounds. There are so many amazing ways to draw sounds out of the things we find around us, and in some of my pieces I try to use everyday items as instruments. In this piece, the ten performers each have a cardboard coffee cup, the kind you get with a takeaway coffee (but empty, and dry!). They also each have to find five different surfaces. These could be anything flat, such as a piece of wood, some felt, a brick, a metal baking tray, and so on.' 'All of the fifty surfaces should be different in some way: this is quite hard to achieve. In the piece, the players are all given stopwatches and have specific times at which they push their cups across the surfaces. They are instructed variously to drag, push, or circle the cups, and are told which way up to hold the cup. This results in many different friction sounds which start and stop, a bit like a machine, with different combinations being created. All of the sounds have a lot of inner detail.'[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The title comes from the idea that different textures on the surfaces they choose affect the sound you hear.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Can you think of 5 surfaces you might use if you played this piece? How do you think they might sound? Try looking around you classroom - can you find 5 different surfaces that have different 'textures'?",

That has influenced the way they make music: you need a powerful voice to be heard on the big, open plains of the country![BREAKPARAGRAPH]Throat singing might not sound very tuneful to us, but if we grew up with it we'd probably think differently.

The hissing and bubbling sounds you can hear come from the diver's oxygen tanks that help them breathe. Could you also hear little whirring sounds from the camera and their equipment knocking against the sides of the pool?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The recording with a special microphone called a 'hydrophone'. Hydrophones are waterproof and can pick up vibrations in the water that make sound. Can you remember any other recordings you have heard in Minute of Listening that have been made with hydrophones?",

Then you pluck it to make a twanging sound.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The player's mouth makes the sound 'resonate' so that it's much louder, and changing the shape of your mouth changes the pitch too! Could you hear the way the musician changed the sound as they played?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The Jew's Harp was used in Asia as far back as the 4th century B.C. It has spread all over the world since then, and is used in many different ways. This recording is from Mongolia and the musician is using a Jew's harp made of bamboo.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]There are over 1000 different names for the instrument. Although English-speaking countries commonly call it a Jew's Harp, it actually has no connection with the Jewish people or faith.

It started in Itsuki - a village in the mountains in South West Japan. People often say that Japanese folk music sounds sad and mournful. Did you think this song sounded sad? There is just one singer singing alone (solo). She is saying that she is very poor and has no one to care for her.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This song is a lullaby.

They were often used in churches. This recording was actually made in a church; Buckland Abbey in Devon.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Harmoniums have a lovely, unique sound. This piece was written quite recently and is full of repetitive melodic patterns and rhythms.

Do you remember the UK folk songs from earlier in this sound pack?

The Appalachians are a huge range of mountains over 1,500 miles long![BREAKPARAGRAPH]The musician on this recording is playing the fiddle (violin); an instrument that is often used in Old-Time Music. The tempo is quite fast. Try silently tapping the pulse as you listen to the music.  The fiddle player performs a fast-moving melody which would have required a lot of dexterity in his left hand. A fast, lively tune like this one would usually be played for people to dance to.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]You could try comparing 'Lost Indian' to the Boscastle Breakdown from week 3 to see what differences you hear!",

They have had a king (known as a 'Kabaka') for over 700 years. He has his own musicians to play for him and perform at important ceremonies. You just listened to some of the royal musicians.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice that rhythm is a big part of this music? There were drums, people clapping their hands, and rattles. Percussion is very important in Baganda music, and people often dance to it.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The words also play an important part in how Baganda music is played. Did you hear the way one musician would sing a line, and then all the other musicians sing together just after him? That's a style of singing known as 'call and response,' which is used in lots of different types of music. Do you know any songs which use call and response? ",

The piano sounds very different to a normal piano because it has been 'prepared'.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Inside every piano, there are hundreds of strings. When the pianist presses down a key on the piano, some of the strings are hit by a hammer inside the instrument, which causes the strings to vibrate and make a sound. This piano has small pieces of rubber, wood and metal squeezed between the strings to make them sound different to a normal piano.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]How many different sounds could you hear coming from this instrument? When John Cage wrote this piece he was influenced by the sound of the gamelan orchestra, which is a set of instruments that people from Indonesia often play.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]A gamelan orchestra has lots of different instruments made from metal that are played by hitting them gently with a stick. Some of the gamelan instruments make a short, high sound but others make a very long deep sound.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]In Cage's piece, the piano plays the same melodic fragment over and over again, almost like the musician is thinking carefully about what they are saying. Did you notice how some of the higher sounds rang out for a long time, but other sounds clicked to a steady pulse throughout? What do you imagine this piece is about? What might the musician be saying? ",

Different textures are created as the strings and brass sometimes blend together closely, and other times work in separate teams.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Gabrieli composed using a style known as 'call and response' (or antiphony), where two groups play similar music one after another, almost like a conversation between two friends. The different groups here are the strings and the brass.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Notice how the instruments play the same melodies one after another, each using their own sound to make a new version of the tune.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you hear how the sounds echoed around in this recording? Even when the instruments stopped playing the sound rang on in the hall where they were performing. What kind of place do you imagine this recording was made in? Do you think the room is big or small?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, see if you can hear an organ playing in the louder sections. The organ plays the long, low notes that continue to echo loudly in parts where no one plays.",

In this piece it is hard to be certain where the beat falls or how the beat is grouped as the instruments busily perform their rhythms and melodies. All of the instruments seem to be bumping into each other, like they're dancing around very quickly.  Did you notice how the high sounds of the piccolo (a small flute) jumped out of the hustle and bustle?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The music is partly inspired by Bluegrass, which is a type of folk music from the USA often played on violins. You might have noticed how the string instruments in this minute were sliding around![BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, try to hear how the instruments come together every now and again before rushing off in different directions.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]What does the music make you imagine?",

Listen to the rich sounds of the strings. Can you hear the falling scale patterns played by the violins. The bell is capable of only one pitch. How many times do you hear it ringing? Perhaps you can remember another piece from Minute of Listening which uses a string orchestra?

That's about the same as five grown-up people! The wildebeest sound very close in today's minute. Perhaps the person making the recording was frightened! How did the sound make you feel?",

Can you remember some other pieces of jazz music from previously in Minute of Listening? The recording has several instruments playing alongside Davis and his trumpet. How many different instruments did you hear? This music was improvised, so you can hear the musicians adding to one another's ideas. If you listen again, think about the way Miles Davis and his band play together. Can you hear how Miles Davies takes the lead the whole time?

What kind of place did you think of?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice the way Fairuz sometimes sang alone, and other times sang together with a group of singers?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]What other sounds did you hear - what about the instruments playing?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Perhaps you heard stringed instruments, percussion instruments and flute-like instruments?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you hear how the singers and instruments take it in turns to play?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The minute begins with only instruments, then the singing becomes the loudest sound and the instruments dip in and out, like little splashes of colour.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]What did you imagine when you listened?",

What did the music make you imagine?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice how only some of the words could be heard over the sound of the hissing recording? The song came from behind a lot of crackling sounds, and when the singer sang a high note at the end, there was a buzzing noise. This is because the minute was recorded in 1908 on a gramophone, which is a very old piece of equipment for recording sounds.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Today it is very easy to make sound recordings on a mobile phone or computer, but when this minute was made, it was much harder to record sounds clearly. It is a bit like looking at a very old black and white photograph - the picture shows light and shadow but misses all of the colours in between.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, try to imagine you are travelling back in time to the day this recording was made. What do you think it might have felt like to hear Joseph Taylor's voice if you were in the same room?

It was almost as though the instruments at the bottom were helping to balance the ones at the top.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you were listening carefully, you might have heard the recorder player take a big breath just after a high note.

The loudest sound was the call of the Bullfrog, which had a deep, slow voice, almost like the \"moo\" of a cow![BREAKPARAGRAPH]You might have heard other sounds in the background too. Did you notice the chirping little voices of the Cricket Frogs, which made very short, crisp sounds? Perhaps you also heard the Barking Frog, which had a deep voice and made a barking noise far off in the distance?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Sometimes, it was hard to pick out all the different kinds of sound from the crowd. It was almost as if the frogs were trying to push each other out of the way to get to the front.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you were listening closely, you might have noticed how some of the sounds started in the distance and jumped forward suddenly. The chirping sound of the Cricket Frog began quietly in the distance but sounded very loud later in the minute.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, try to imagine the kind of place where this minute was recorded. How many frogs do you think there were, were they big or small? How do you think it might have felt to be standing in the middle of all of them all?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Find out more about Bullfrogs.

Did you think the music sounded like a celebration, perhaps you imagined something else?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This piece of music was created for lots of different sized bells - the largest bells made the lowest sounds, and the smallest bells were the highest. Bells make a sound when they are hit by small hammers to make them vibrate.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you were listening closely, you might have noticed how the bells made a tune that was repeated again and again. Each time a bell was struck, there was a clear, loud sound, which gradually faded away.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice that, as the sounds faded away, they wobbled up and down? This sound is called the resonance, which is the noise that gradually disappears after a bell has been struck.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, try to imagine the kind of place where you might hear this music. Do you think the minute was recorded indoors or outside?",

When musicians learn to play tabla, they begin by learning how to sing the rhythms of Indian music, just like in this minute.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice how the rhythms in this piece kept chopping and changing? They switched from being very fast and busy to being quite slow and simple in just a few seconds.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]How do you think it might feel to sing this music - can you imagine the sounds bouncing off your tongue and rolling around your mouth?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Watch a TEDx video about Indian tabla.

The orchestra had lots of percussion instruments, which make sounds when they are hit with sticks. Some of the percussion instruments made high, clicking sounds, and others made very low rumbling sounds.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]When John Casken wrote this piece of music, he wanted to create a musical version of Apollinaire's poem.

How would you describe the sounds you heard?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Throughout the minute, there was a clicking pulse, almost like a clock keeping time, whilst the other sounds faded in and out. Did you notice how most of the sounds were short and crackly, except for the last sound, which was smooth and long?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, try to hear how the higher sounds copy the lower ones. Each time a new sound is heard, it is copied and changed higher up. You might even hear some sounds get higher and higher until they disappear altogether.",

How many did you hear?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Perhaps you heard the bright sound of the melodeon? A melodeon is a musical box that can be stretched and squashed to suck in or blow out air, which is how it makes a sound. It also has lots of buttons on each end to make the sounds higher or lower.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you hear the click-clack of the buttons being pressed, or the rustling, whooshing sound of the melodeon being squashed and stretched by the musician?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you also hear the tapping of feet against the floor? These sounds came from a dancer who was performing something called a \"step dance\". Did you notice how all of his footsteps created a rhythm that was in time with the sound of the melodeon? It was almost as though the tapping of his feet was a drum playing along as part of the music, as well as a dance.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This minute was recorded in Suffolk where everyone was having a party! Did you hear the sound of people chattering and clapping in the background, or the creaky opening and closing of doors? What kind of place did you imagine when you listened - did it sound like a fun place to be? Visit the English Folk Dance and Song Society's online Resource Bank.

When musicians learn to play tabla, they begin by learning how to sing the rhythms of Indian music, just like in this minute.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice how the rhythms in this piece kept chopping and changing? They switched from being very fast and busy to being quite slow and simple in just a few seconds.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]How do you think it might feel to sing this music - can you imagine the sounds bouncing off your tongue and rolling around your mouth?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Watch a TEDx video about Indian tabla.

All the sounds were played on a piano - how did you imagine the sounds were made?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]A piano makes sounds when a musician presses a key. The keys cause small, soft hammers to hit strings inside the instrument, making them vibrate. All the strings are different lengths, so they each vibrate differently, and make sounds of different pitches.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Because the piano has lots of strings, it echoes whenever one is hit or plucked. Did you hear the clicks and splutters from inside the piano as the different strings all joined in?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]In this minute, the musician was creating unusual timbres by playing inside the piano, which means that, rather than pressing the keys, they were plucking and hitting the strings with their hands! Can you remember any other pieces, from previously in Minute of Listening, that used instruments in unusual ways?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]When you are sitting in front of a piano, the strings making the low sounds are on your left, and the high sounding strings are on your right. If you were listening carefully, you might have heard how every loud sound in this minute was followed by quieter sounds higher up or lower down.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, try to imagine how the different sounds in this minute might travel around the piano. Some might start low down on your left and move up high to your right, or pass back and forth like flies buzzing around!",

Why do you think the person making this recording was so interested in the sound of the skylark?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]When you listened, did you notice how the sounds would suddenly change from high-pitched squeaks to long squawks? Every second of the minute was different, even though lots of short sounds came back again and again.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The skylark's song was almost like a collage, with lots of different sounds all jumbled together.

When he played very quickly, all of the sounds were jumbled up - there were twanging sounds, clicks and pops, and loud scraping noises, all squeezed together.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]At other times, he left more space between sounds, making room for delicate high notes to jump out, or for the strong low strings on the guitar to vibrate.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This music is partly improvised, which means that the musician composes some of the music whilst they are playing.

The children also added their own words to this song.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]There were some instruments playing along too, including a melodeon. Can you remember what a melodeon is from previously in Minute of Listening? How many other kinds of sounds did you hear?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice how the singing and clapping, and the sounds of the instruments, jumped in and out to make the music full of energy? Perhaps you heard how, when everyone clapped and played together, the sound echoed all around the room?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The song is in the form of a call and response with two responses. The first one is \"Away Santiana\" can you hear the words for the second? The call is unison and it is likely that this would have been sung originally as a solo. The responses are for everyone to sing and includes some two-part singing. The words in this song are about a famous man called Antonio L¢pez de Santa Anna, who was the leader of an old Mexican army. The title 'Santianna' is another way of singing his name - it is almost as though the singers are talking about what is happening in the news![BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, imagine what it might be like to be a sailor singing this song aboard a ship on the ocean. Where might your ship be travelling? Would you have to raise your voice up over the sounds of the sea and wind blowing around you?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]You can visit the English Folk Dance and Song Society's online Resource Bank.

Every now and again, you could hear the singer snatching quick breaths in between the long phrases she was singing.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Perhaps you heard how the woman used her voice to make little flicks, changing pitch quickly up and down, almost like she was adding splashes of colour?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The sounds from the harmonium were solid and strong, and the woman's voice was full of little changes and unexpected sounds.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]You could imagine the harmonium as the ground underneath your feet, and the woman's voice as a tree slowly growing out of the soil. What did the music make you imagine?",

Perhaps you noticed the station announcer telling people where the next train was travelling to?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The escalator sounded like a huge machine creaking away amongst the other noises of the station. If you listened very closely, you might have noticed how the escalator made a quiet clicking sound all the way through, with scrapes and screeches popping up suddenly.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Every screech the escalator made was slightly different - some were short, some were longer and went up and down.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]What kind of place did you imagine when you were listening - do you think the train station where this was recorded was big or small?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, see if you can hear the way the sound echoes around the room. The loud screeches from the escalator bounce all around the space, whilst the quieter clicking sounds hardly echo at all. Hear more from the London Sound Survey. This minute is part of a collection of field recordings called the London Sound Survey. The survey collects together hundreds of different sound recordings from around London and puts them on a map so you can go and listen to them yourself.",

This piece was inspired by the music of a rock band from the 1990s called Faith No More.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Clancy wrote this piece to imagine what kind of music the band might create if they had a whole orchestra. You could think of it as a kind of musical recycling, where old music is turned into something new![BREAKPARAGRAPH]There are lots of musicians in an orchestra, but in this piece, everyone in the orchestra played together. The very high, ringing sounds were balanced by the deep brassy sounds and heavy drum.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Perhaps you heard how the drum and brass instruments kept the beat and the higher instruments jumped around on top?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]You could imagine the sounds in this minute as a very tall building - up at the top, the high sounds are the decorations that catch the sunlight, and at the bottom, the low sounds are the solid bricks that keep everything steady.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, try to hear how, even though the musicians in the orchestra are working together, not all instruments play on every beat of the music. Imagine you are dancing to the music, which sounds would you dance to?",

Perhaps you noticed that, even though all of the children sang the same tune together, each one of their voices was slightly different?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Some children sang loudly and confidently, and others sang more quietly and softly.

It tells the story of a man who falls in love with a woman who is weaving cloth in a factory.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This song is over 350 years old! The words and the tune have gradually changed over the years and the music you listened to is a modern arrangement of the song.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This minute had men and women singing together.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The women sang a rhythm that went round and round, just like the sound of the 'shuttles' in the weaving machines in the factory, whirring back and forth. If you keep the pulse gently as you listen, you might notice that this music is in a metre of 5! The men were singing the story of how the two people fell in love. Their voices carried the tune, which hopped around on top of the rhythms sung by the women.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]When you listened, did you notice how the women's voices were mostly in the background, and the men's were louder and clearer? At one point, you might have noticed a small group of women's voices leap out to sing a different tune, then join the others again.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The composer who arranged this version of the  song was inspired by the sounds from the  whirring machines and spinning wheels. Can you think of any sounds at home or in your classroom that could be turned into music? Perhaps there are humming pipes or rumbling buses that sound musical to you?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Visit the English Folk Dance and Song Society's online Resource Bank.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Find out more about folk songs like the one you just heard, and hear them being sung.",

Did you notice the twinkling sound of violins plucking their strings, together with a harp playing very high sounds?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]You might also have heard a trumpet and an oboe taking it in turns to play the phrases of the melody. Every few seconds, the musicians came together to play a splash of sound, like a big drop of rain hitting the ground.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Try to imagine a very dry land, where all the people, animals and plants are desperate for water.

Did you notice the sound of the bow scraping across the strings as the musician played? Every now and again there were little pops and squeaks as his bow caught the strings in different ways.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Perhaps you heard how some notes rang out loudly and had a smoother, richer sound than the rest of the music? You might also have heard how the musician sometimes bowed more than one string at a time to play two notes at once.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice the musician humming along as he played? You could hear his voice in the background, quieter than the sound of his violin, almost as though he was singing to himself![BREAKPARAGRAPH]This recording was made in a studio, which means that the musician was playing in a special room where no other sounds could get in.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Most of the time though, this music would be played to accompany Morris dancing, when everyone would be having fun. Can you remember any other music for Morris dancing, from previously in Minute of Listening? How would you dance to the tune Jinky Wells was playing?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]See the Beginners' Guide to English Folk Dance.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Watch children performing different folk dances.

Do you think the music fitted the story?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice how the singer's voice was accompanied by lots of short, spiky sounds moving around in a hurry, almost like they were travelling quickly on a journey? Many of the sounds were made by musical instruments, such as harps and guitars. How many different kinds of sounds did you hear?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]You might have also heard a clicking sound all the way through the minute.

Did you notice the trumpeting elephant, or the barking dogs? There were also screaming and grunting sounds coming from all around. Sometimes, you could hear the animals panting and breathing heavily.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you were listening closely, you might have heard how some of the sounds were deep and low down, whilst others where very high and shrill. What kinds of animals do you think might have made these different noises? Perhaps some animals were very big and others were very small?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice how all of the animals seemed to be minding their own business? Each animal was making its own sounds and paying no attention to the others. It was a bit like a school playground where everyone was playing a different game at the same time![BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, try to think about the kind of place where this was recorded. Can you hear the animals' feet clipping against a hard floor? What about the way the louder sounds echo? Do you think these animals are roaming around outside, or sitting indoors in cages?",

When musicians learn to play tabla, they begin by learning how to sing the rhythms of Indian music, just like in this minute.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you notice how the rhythms in this piece kept chopping and changing? They switched from being very fast and busy to being quite slow and simple in just a few seconds.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]How do you think it might feel to sing this music - can you imagine the sounds bouncing off your tongue and rolling around your mouth?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Watch a TEDx video about Indian tabla.

Two instruments you might have heard are a violin and a double bass.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Violins and double basses each have four strings, which can be bowed to create a smooth sound or plucked to make crisp, short noises.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]In this piece, did you hear how the musicians playing the violin and double bass sometimes bowed and sometimes (towards the end) plucked their strings to make a different , percussive sound?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you were listening very carefully, you might have noticed how the music chopped and changed between different groups of instruments - sometimes there were lots of instruments together, and other times there were only one or two people playing.",

The high voice moved around a lot but the lower voice didn't move very much at all, except when they both sang \"five gold rings\"! At the end of the minute went down very deep.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you also notice the hiss and crackle of the recording? This is because the minute was recorded a long time ago, when it was more difficult to capture sound clearly.

This is because the bassoonist was using a \"distortion pedal\" to change the sound of their instrument with a computer.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Some of the sounds in this minute were very distorted. If you were listening carefully, you might have heard how the musician sometimes played more than one note at a time, making a loud buzzing sound.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Often, the bassonist would start low down, then climb up high and repeat the same note again and again. Did you notice how they slightly changed the sound of notes every time they were repeated, creating a kind of wobbling effect?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]When the musician played very quickly, it sounded like they were showing off to everyone listening!

There were lots of echoing, swirling sounds in the background, like shadows flickering around.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you were listening very carefully, you might have heard how the echoing sounds kept coming together to make new sounds, and then flew off again different directions.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This minute collected together many different recorded sounds, including bells, plucked strings and a drum, stretching and squashing them using a computer.

The music you heard in this minute was based on a piece by John Dowland, composed in around 1600.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Tansy Davies took Dowland's music and turned it into something new. Can you think of any other pieces, from previously in Minute of Listening, that made new sounds from old pieces of music?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Sometimes, all of the viol players in this minute played their own tunes at the same time. Perhaps you noticed how their sounds clashed against each other?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]At the end of the minute, the music calmed down and the musicians took it in turns to play short fragments of melody. Did you hear the players hop in and out of the beat whilst one played the tune?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]There are small viols, like violins, and large viols, like cellos. If you were listening closely, you might have heard how some of the viols played low, heavy sounds, and others made high, delicate sounds[BREAKPARAGRAPH]If you listen again, try to follow some of the melodies played by the different viols.

Since these humble beginnings the survey has grown to over 2,000 recordings and become Ian’s full time vocation.\r\n\r\nUsing historical and present day maps and grid references the site is divided into six sections: London Map, Sound Actions, Sound Map, Wildlife, Historical and Blog. The project receives no external funding with all audio files being published under a creative commons (non-commercial) licence.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of metadata with nearly all the sound files has made the London Sound Survey's material useful to postgraduate researchers working in fields such as geography and auditory perception. \r\n\r\nA sense of history is provided through written testimonials. However these prove difficult to find the further back you go, partly because writers before the 19th century dwell more on action and dialogue than on sensory descriptions. Samuel Pepys's diaries stand out (arguably because he had highly developed musical skills). Their highly intimate and confessional nature let him describe sounds that startled and alarmed him.\r\n\r\nIan Rawes regularly gives talks, and writes a blog about subjects including field recording, London history and literature, other websites worth looking at, articles in the press, and news of sound-related events.\r\n\r\nFun Fact\r\nThe London Sound Survey runs on tea and batteries.\r\n",

The label believed that music could be used as a tool for cultural and educational revolution and that folk music passed down the generations gave a voice to the people.\r\n\r\nThe first title in Topic Record’s catalogue was “The Man That Waters Down The Beer” by Paddy Ryan. As well as aiming to present British industrial and urban folksong, they played an important role in disseminating the work of American folk singers such as Paul Robeson and Woody Guthrie.\r\n\r\nThroughout the 50s and 60s their reputation became firmly established and a blossoming audience for folk music surfaced.\r\n\r\nNotable performers who recorded for Topic include The Spinners, Vanessa Redgrave, Jeannie Robertson and The Watersons. However the label was not exclusively focused on British and American Music, and also released collections from Bulgaria, Albania, Greece and Turkey.\r\n\r\nCurrent director Tony Engle oversaw a rich period of releases by seminal artists in the 70s including Martin Carthy, widely acknowledged to have influenced the work of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon and one of the forerunners of the contemporary folk revival.\r\nIn recent years Topic has continued to release new recordings as well as reissuing the very best of its back catalogue, including a 20 volume anthology of traditional music from the UK entitled The Voice of The People .\r\n\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nIn the labels early days some of their releases were on 8inch vinyl rather than the more usual 12inch. The story goes that this was because they picked up a free job lot of 8inch vinyl blanks and a machine that would press them\r\n",

He has held research associateships at the Royal College of Music and the Science Museum, as well as a residency with the British Library Sound Archive in partnership with Sound and Music.\r\n\r\nHis work has been shown across Europe and in the USA, and broadcast by the BBC, WDR, Deutschlandradio and others.\r\n\r\nKolkowski uses historical recording and reproduction apparatus and obsolete media to make contemporary mechanical-acoustic music.\r\n\r\nHis numerous international projects have combined wax cylinder phonographs, gramophones and vintage disc recording machines alongside live musicians. \r\n\r\nHis performances and installations often emphasise archaic techniques of sound amplification and modes of listening allowing him to explore sound as memory, our relationship to technology and to time travel – hearing the present through the sound recording media of the past.\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nSince 2013 Kolkowski has collaborated in The X-Ray Audio Project by The Real Tuesday Weld frontman Stephen Coates. \r\n",

He is a renowned session and solo musician who works across many genres from pop, rock and jazz through to more eclectic and experimental styles.\r\n\r\nInitially inspired by The Shadows he learnt guitar at an early age; however by 1963 a performance from the American duo Santo &amp; Johnny encouraged a move to the lap steel and soon after he acquired his first pedal steel - a Fender 1000.\r\n\r\nHis breakthrough moment came in 1971, playing steel guitar on Elton John’s ‘Tiny Dancer’, included on the album Madman Across the Water. This demonstrated what Cole and the steel guitar were capable of, creating a context for the instrument in other artists’ work.\r\n\r\nThroughout his career he has been in constant demand as a session musician appearing with artists such as Roger Daltry, Procul Harem, Joan Armatrading, Cat Stevens, The Walker Brothers, Paul Young and The Stranglers amongst many others.\r\n\r\nHe continues to work with high profile and more experimental artists including Bjork, The Orb, Spiritualised, Robbie Williams and Brian Eno.\r\nHis solo work has always been experimental, and involves working as a performer as well as a writer, arranger, mixer and producer.\r\n\r\nCole has pioneered the use of the pedal steel outside of American Country music where he feels he is pushing boundaries in bringing the exotic, yearning sound to unfamiliar contexts. A shared passion for exotica and drum ‘n’ bass culminated in ‘Stop the Panic’ an electronica album with Luke Vibert and later on 2004’s ‘Trouble in Paradise’ including appearances by Groove Armada and Alabama 3.\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nNever content to stand still, BJ now makes his unique sound palette available to recording artists, songwriters and record producers via his 'Online Overdub Service', which he has set up as an economical and speedy way to get his Pedal Steel on to your recordings via the internet. \r\n",

            "v": "Alfred William \"Bob\" Roberts was a British folk singer, songwriter, storyteller, bargeman, author, and journalist associated particularly with the Suffolk coast. He was the last captain of a British commercial sailing vessel.\r\nBob Roberts was brought up in a musical family. Both his parents taught in the local school and his father ran the church choir, played the piano, church organ, melodeon, concertina and fiddle.\r\n\r\nHe gained a choral scholarship to Wimborne Grammar School, which he left at 17 to become a journalist, eventually working as a sports reporter for the Daily Mail on Fleet Street. However his real love was sailing, both for work and pleasure, and he went on two long sea voyages complete with ship’s cat and melodeon before leaving the newspaper to work as a mate, and then a skipper on a Thames sailing barge.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1960’s he ran the Cambria sailing boat as an owner-skipper before replacing it with a small motor coaster which he used to carry china clay, coke, soya beans and scrap metal around the UK and over to Europe.\r\n\r\nHe moved to the Isle of Wight with his wife Toni in the 1970’s and recorded his last two albums.\r\nWorking as a bargeman allowed Roberts to collect songs from bargemen and others he met along the East Anglian coast, which he added to his repertoire of his own songs. During this time he carried on writing to supplement his income with books and articles.\r\n\r\nHe had amassed quite a repertoire of songs by the 1950s and gained a reputation as a great singer and storyteller, respected by musicians and bargemen alike. A meeting with folklorist Peter Kennedy, who was making recordings for the English Folk Dance and Song Society and the BBC, led to them working together recording various musicians for a BBC folk programme.\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nIn 1966, Roberts read five seafaring stories on the BBC children's programme Jackanory.\r\n\r\n",

She was co-founder and the first director of the world-renowned BBC Radiophonic workshop. She left in 1959 and carried on her own research into sound in relative secrecy.\r\n\r\nHer work, collected papers and other items passed into the care of her friend the artist Hugh Davies after her death in 2003. It was subsequently bequeathed to the Sonic Arts Network (one of Sound and Music’s founding organisations). It is now available to researchers, musicians and others at Goldsmiths College in London. This archive also includes fascinating documents relating to her approaches and studies of electronic music.\r\n\r\n\r\nOram most famously developed Oramics, one of the earliest forms of electronic sound synthesis and one that is audio-visual in nature. The composer draws onto a synchronised set of ten 35mm film strips which overlay a series of photo-electric cells, generating electrical charges to control amplitude, timbre, frequency, and duration.\r\n\r\nKey works include Pulse Persephone (1965), Bird of Parallax (1972), Rockets in Ursa Major (1962), Broceliande (1969-70), and the soundtrack to the feature film The Innocents (1961).\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nBesides being a musical innovator, she was the first woman to direct an electronic music studio, the first woman to set up a personal electronic music studio and the first woman to design and construct an electronic musical instrument.\r\n",

This work has included: a piece for mass brass players controlled by semaphore flags on Aldeburgh beach; a project at Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival exploring the sounds (and taste!) of rhubarb; the Fanfare project at the Royal Opera House, enabling teenage composers to write interval fanfares performed and recorded by the orchestra; and a composition for Birmingham Contemporary Music Group for 3 players and electronics, with environmental sounds collected by groups of primary school children.\r\n\r\nMost recently Duncan and Isabel Jones, in collaboration with deafblind artist Lewis Jones and supported by Sound and Music, have toured White Cane. This was a series of site-specific performances touring nationally, where audiences wearing wireless headphones were immersed in a sound world created by visually impaired dancer Mickel Smithen and blind musician Takashi Kikuchi, and exploring and navigating public space. As the long cane rolls across the surface of each space, we hear its sound, which is combined with live music and spoken and sung audio description to create a unique experience of ‘sonic vision’.\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nAmongst other things, Duncan is interested in vegetables as musical instruments.\r\n",

He was discouraged from learning the piano by his father, and became proficient in the guitar and flute. His early compositions were small arrangements, romances and chamber pieces.\r\n\r\nHe turned his back on a career in medicine to follow his passion for music, and went on to compose works that showcased the innovativeness and search for expression that were hallmarks of Romanticism. \r\n\r\nBerlioz had a romantic soul and a great affection for literature, particularly the writing of Thomas de Quincy, Goethe, Byron and Shakespeare - who inspired many of his best-known works. Whilst only twelve he learned to read Latin and translated Virgil, whose works made him weep, into French. \r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nFor the opening of Stanley Kubrick's film ,The Shining’, composer Wendy Carlos re-interpreted the ‘Dies Irae’ section of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique using a Moog synthesizer.\r\n",

He has spent most of his life in London working as a printer, book designer, market stallholder, concert promoter and sound archivist.\r\n\r\nIan gives regular talks and interviews about The London Sound Survey \r\nRawes’ interest in sounds of the city was sparked while working in the sound archives at the British Library. He was introduced to tapes made by amateurs and enthusiasts, from recordings of birdsong to one man’s collection of the sound of every bus journey in Yorkshire. Ian’s first recording was of the sounds of an average day at a noisy clothes market in Petticoat Lane on the edge of London’s East End. Listening to the recordings he was taken aback by the novelty of bringing the sounds of the outdoors inside.\r\n\r\nHe carried on making recordings of life in London and a year later launched a website to house them. The London Sound Survey now contains over 2,000 recordings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nWhy focus on sounds? “It pulls you into a sense of place more effectively than a photograph does,” he says, and audio can be better at “conveying subtle emotions that are hard to put into words.”\r\n\r\n",

In 1949 she arrived in Britain with her first husband, and continued her studies at the University of London, at the School of Oriental and African Studies.\r\n\r\nIn 1954 she joined the staff of the Horniman Museum in South London where she built up the musical instrument collections from developing countries, conducted important fieldwork in Ethiopia and created a centre for ethnomusicology. \r\n\r\nJenkins travelled widely throughout Africa and Central Asia between the 1950s and 1980s creating exceptional recordings, and taking detailed notes.\r\n\r\nAfter curating the 1976 exhibition “Music and Musical Instruments for the World of Islam” introducing the collections to a much wider audience, she left the museum and continued to work independently in Edinburgh, France and Germany. In 1983 she curated the important exhibition “Man and Music” at the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh. \r\n\r\nIn 1980 the National Museum of Scotland acquired Jean Jenkins’s private collection of musical instruments and in 1990 was gifted her archive of field recordings, indexes, diaries and 13,000 slides and photographs.\r\n\r\nIt is believed to be one of the broadest musical recording archives ever collected by a single person.\r\nHer passion was music as a played form and she recorded all forms of music, always carrying the latest recording technology. She was a key figure in laying the ground for the contemporary world music scene, and as well as insight into traditional music from around the world. Her recordings include classical, court, popular, folk and religious music. She always documented the context in which music was performed, collecting information, taking photographs, making notes and buying musical instruments.\r\n\r\nJenkins’s musical instrument collections include percussion, wind and string instruments, such as harps, trumpets, fiddles, flutes and drums. \r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nShe married her second husband and obtained a British passport in order to avoid being deported to the US for her trade union work. \r\n",

He moved to London in the mid 1960’s where he immersed himself in the alternative scene, co-founding the Drury Lane Arts Lab space. He was awarded The Whitbread Prize in 1966 before heading to Amsterdam where he co-launched Suck newspaper.  \r\n\r\nHaynes taught Media Studies and Sexual Politics for 30 years at the University of Paris and published an irregular newsletter about his life and times. In addition he has written an autobiographical memoir, titled Thanks for Coming. \r\n\r\nIn the late 80s, he edited a series of guidebooks to nine Eastern European countries and Russia. Rather than the usual tourist hot spots each book contained about 1,000 short biographies of people who would be willing to welcome travellers in their cities. Many friendships evolved from these encounters, including marriages and babies. \r\n \r\n\r\nHe collaborated with RK Faulhaber, MS Waldron (irr. app. (ext.)), Steven Stapleton (Nurse With Wound) &amp; Sigtryggur Berg Sigmarsson (Stilluppsteypa) on The Sleeping Moustache – described by the Helen Scarsdale agency as “an exquisite manifestation of sound poetry scattered into a tortuous collage mired in an oblique melancholy.”\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nEvery week since the early 1970’s Jim has hosted a Sunday dinner in his Paris home, which is open to anyone including total strangers. People from all corners of the world come to break bread together, to meet, to talk, connect and often become friends. Jim loves the randomness and believes in introducing people to people.\r\n",

Her work uses the pure tones of concert and bass flutes alongside DIY dulcimers and electronics to create immersive yet restrained textures that weave in and out of each other.\r\n\r\nEnglish has been cited as a distinct voice, taking the flute away from its pastoral image whilst maintaining its unique mellow sound. \r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nKatie also runs workshops that have included paper craft, musical instrument making and collage printing. \r\n",

            "v": "Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer and pianist crucial to the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. He is regarded as one of the most important and influential musical figures of all time. \r\n\r\nBeethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age as a child prodigy. He moved to Vienna (where he lived until his death) at the age of 21 and studied composition under Joseph Haydn, gaining a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. His long-term benefactor Count Waldstein suggested in his farewell letter to Beethoven that through Haydn’s hands and diligent hard work he would receive the spirit of Mozart who along with Beethoven’s father had recently passed away. Clearly this had an effect, as the work from this period is distinctly Mozartean in character.\r\n\r\nHis best-known compositions include 9 symphonies, 5 piano concertos, 1 violin concerto, 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, his great Missa solemnis, and one opera, Fidelio.\r\nHe was the first composer to use a choir in a symphony, in the last movement of his famous Ninth Symphony where he set the words of Friedrich von Schiller as an ‘Ode to Joy’. Nowadays this is well known as the European anthem.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that his immediate predecessors Mozart and Haydn had an influence on Beethoven. However Beethoven’s melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart. Building on their example Beethoven continually strove to stretch the bounds of music to new limits. \r\nEach of his nine symphonies is completely different from any previous one, and he showed similar originality in every major genre of the time. He achieved his goal through a combination of natural genius and sheer hard work: every one of his major compositions is the result of painstaking refinement, evident in the many thousands of pages of musical sketches that he wrote.\r\nThe quality of his music has ensured his lasting reputation. Its combination of beauty and unpredictability, extreme emotional depth and intellectual rigour, across so many genres, is regarded as unsurpassed.\r\nFun Fact\r\nMany of Beethovens most admired works were created in the last 15 years of his life when he was almost completely deaf.\r\n",

He won the fiddle contest during the 1937 Black Gold Festival in Hazrad. Throughout his career he played with many other musicians including the Payroll Boys, Cousin Emmy, Molly O’Day, Lynn Davis, Eddie Hill and Johnnie Wright. \r\n\r\nSumner lived up to his title of Fiddle King developing a following amongst fans of country music.\r\n\r\nIn 1979, he cut a well-received album for June Appal. In the mid-80s, he recorded two more albums, both with the assistance of Jesse McReynolds, who always held Marion’s fiddling in high regard. \r\n\r\nHe travelled extensively working the nightclub circuits of Cincinnati, Columbus and Knoxville but recorded very little. Perhaps his best-known song is ‘Lost Indian’, which appears on a number of compilations of recordings by similar artists. His work is hard to find, but can be heard on compilations released by Smithsonian Folkways.\r\nMarion Sumner's influence as a fiddler upon others of his generation was notable, particularly on Kenny Baker, who won wide acclaim as a sideman for Bill Monroe over a long period.\r\n",

His first record to receive world-wide distribution was Bodily Functions in 2001, which sampled and manipulated internal organs.\r\n\r\nHe is constantly in demand as a producer and remixer working with the likes of Moloko, Motorbass, Alter Ego, Ron Trent, Bjork and Jamie Lidell.\r\n\r\nMatthew Herbert set up Accidental Records to bring all of his early releases and new work under the same umbrella. He has also collaborated with the music course at Goldsmiths to create NX Records, which has spawned artists such as James Blake.\r\n\r\nHe has released two Big Band Albums – Goodbye Swingtime (2003) and There’s me and There’s you for which he recorded inside the Houses of Parliament, at a landfill site, and in the lobby of the British Museum with 70 volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe Brexit Big Band is his most recent undertaking - a two-year collaborative project right across Europe, celebrating artistic and musical collaboration and communities across national borders, leading up to an album on the date Britain leaves the EU.\r\n\r\nHis work has increasingly developed a strong political edge. Plat du Jour, a record made entirely from objects and situations in the food chain, includes a the sound of a tank driving over a recreation of the dinner that Nigella Lawson cooked for George Bush and Tony Blair.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 he created a Manifesto that exists as a set of guidelines for his own music making process. A few of the rules include: No drum machines. No synthesizers. No presets. No replication of traditional acoustic instruments is allowed where the financial and physical possibility of using the real ones exists.\r\n\r\nFun Fact\r\nIn 2012, he was appointed as the creative director of the newly revived BBC Radiophonic Workshop.\r\n\r\n",

He searches for sonic qualities that are able to characterize histories, emotions, and dimensionality in a way that visual representation is thought to. The resulting sound works often demand a great deal of time from the listener. \r\n\r\n",

He has provided drum programming, keyboard sounds, electronics, remix and production duties for the likes of: Primal Scream, Blur, Badly Drawn Boy, Pet Shop Boys, John Cale, Mercury Rev, Coldcut and William Shatner.\r\n\r\nSince 2007 Franglen has collaborated with Charles Casey of Akasha as guitar electronica duo Blacksand. Blacksand are notable for the unusual locations in which they perform their extended live improvisations, which include down a mine, inside a submarine and inside Pyestock, an abandoned scientific testing facility.\r\n\r\nHis more recent solo and installation work investigates the relationship between people and unusual spaces, which developed from his fascination with the locations in which Blacksand performed.\r\n\r\n‘Hymn to London Bridge (2010)’ is a 24-hour performance in which Nick played the Theremin underneath London Bridge. Sensors mounted on the bridge above him registered members of the public crossing the bridge and provided moments of silence in the composition.\r\n‘Hive’ is created by 50 transistor radio sets, each tuned to a different station and left to play inside an enclosed dome. It is an investigation into and comment on how we deal with the increasing torrent of information with which we are confronted, and the choices we make in filtering that information.\r\n\r\nFranglen is inspired by the urban landscape and other found spaces, from London and Manhattan Bridges to a submarine, a mine and jet engine test bed. His unusual and thought provoking work contextualises its environment, providing an often spontaneous, improvised reaction to time and place.\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\n\r\nIn his spare time Nick enjoys diving deep wrecks in the English Channel and the submerged caves of South Wales. Both of these hobbies scare the living daylights out of him.\r\n",

He was initially educated for a career as a civil servant before entering the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western teaching he received here set him apart from his contemporaries, and he combined these influences with the more traditional music of his childhood forming a personal Russian style.\r\n\r\nHis most famous works include the music for the ballets The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker.\r\n\r\n\r\nTchaikovsky was a prolific composer whose music is characterised by tuneful, openhearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration that evokes a profound emotional response. \r\n\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nTchaikovsky could afford to resign from the Moscow Conservatory in 1878, thanks to the patronage of a wealthy widow named Nadezhda von Meck. She provided him with a monthly allowance until 1890; oddly, their arrangement stipulated that they would never meet.\r\n",

He also works in music production.\r\nIn 2007 he worked on a DIY music project called \"The Schema\" – an attempt to get a single written, recorded, released and promoted on the internet in the space of a month. The accompanying video, directed by Alex de Campi and featuring Marysia Kay, was a hit on YouTube, but the single sold poorly.\r\nAs well as writing and making music Marsden gives talks and lectures about music, earthquakes and lost love.\r\nRhodri Marsden is the proud winner of the Under-10s Piano prize at the 1980 Watford Music festival.\r\n",

Most of these sound recordings have come from donations and many are unique to the Library.\r\n\r\nAlongside recordings specific to the various species, the Wildlife Sound Archive contains atmospheric, environmental and natural sounds such as woodlands, rainforests, coastlines, waterfalls, rivers and thunder.\r\n\r\nA large number of recordings have been digitised, and are searchable and freely available to listen to online. \r\n\r\nThe British Library offers training workshops and events in oral history and wildlife sound recording, as well as audio-visual archiving internships.\r\n\r\nFun Fact\r\nThe British Library staff contribute to a blog about the wider collection, which includes a ‘recording of the week’, highlighting some of the wonderful material in the collections.\r\n",

Die Schachtel seeks therefore to create a link between these pioneers and a new generation of experimental musicians, who may never have been aware of the extraordinary musical and creative heritage left by great musicians like Pietro Grossi and Enore Zaffiri.\r\n\r\nEach of the labels releases are limited to between 300-500 copies, and are produced to the highest quality with comprehensive information about the artists. \r\n\r\nDie Schachtel is also an independent and not-for-profit art gallery. Across all of its work, it is devoted to Sound as both an art form, and as a platform for critical discourse. \r\n\r\n\r\nFun Fact\r\nDie Schachtel prides itself on the fact that its mailorder site offers for sale ‘those weird records and CDs you have only read about never seen’.\r\n",

They were the first language training company to recognize the potential of combining a traditional written approach to learning a language with recordings (firstly on wax cylinder, and later with records).\r\n\r\nFor many years it offered language courses via tape recorders installed in school ‘language laboratories’. These were specially designed to work on two separate tracks: a master track with the teachers' voices that could only be listened to but not erased, and another track for the students, where the students could record and erase their own voices as often as they liked.\r\n\r\nThese days, Linguaphone’s portfolio of self-study language products is sold in more than 60 countries worldwide.

It has been a self-governing orchestra since 1964 and is owned by its 80 members.\r\n\r\nAlongside performing in its London home the Orchestra performs at UK residencies and across the world. It leads the field in the quality of playing, innovative work with music education, audience development and the use of new technology to reach a global audience.\r\n\r\nCentral to the Philharmonia and Esa-Pekka Salonen’s work in London, the UK and internationally are their digital projects, all of which are designed to communicate the thrill of the experience of a live orchestra to audiences outside the concert hall. In September 2016, in partnership with Southbank Centre, the Orchestra presented The Virtual Orchestra, a free two-week series in the public spaces of Royal Festival Hall, culminating with a specially programmed concert at the venue. The project featured the first major Virtual Reality presentation from a UK symphony orchestra, and a giant audio-visual installation of Holst’s The Planets entitled Universe of Sound.\r\n\r\nMillions of people since 1945 have enjoyed their first experience of classical music through a Philharmonia recording, and today audiences engage with the Orchestra through video games, film scores and its award-winning portfolio of videos and documentary films. An app, The Orchestra for iPad, released in December 2012, has sold tens of thousands of copies.\r\n\r\nThe Philharmonia has a variety of programs for education and emerging artists, which reaches tens of thousands of people every year. Recent projects include intergenerational music making, collaborative schools projects, the Composers Academy and the Philharmonia Instrumental Fellowship Programme – an enhanced offer for young musicians, supporting instrumentalists seeking an orchestral career and connecting them to the wider life of the Philharmonia and the expertise within its membership.\r\n\r\n\r\nFun Fact\r\nThe Philharmonia’s first ever concert was conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham for a fee of one cigar.\r\n",

They believe that musical and cultural diversity contributes to the vitality and quality of life throughout the world.\r\n\r\nBefore it was acquired by the Smithsonian Institute, Folkways Recordings released over 2,000 albums including music from around the world, poetry, spoken word and natural sounds. They were an early ambassador of the singers and writers of the American folk music revival, including such greats as Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly, and went on to become one of the most influential record companies in the world.\r\n\r\nA condition of the Smithsonian Institute acquiring Folkways was that almost all of the label’s titles would remain in print forever, ensuring that the sounds and genius of its artists would be available for future generations.\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian Institute have subsequently expanded on the initial collection, releasing over 375 new recordings. The current collection consists of more than 3,000 albums and 43,000 tracks along with videos, playlists, podcasts, lesson plans for teachers, and Smithsonian Folkways Magazine.\r\n\r\nDue to the unique nature of its recordings Smithsonian Folkways has become an important collection for the musical community, especially to ethnomusicologists, who utilise the recordings of \"people's music\" from all over the world.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 they launched the Smithsonian Global Sound educational initiative – a unique online resource giving easy access streaming and downloads for tens of thousands of audio recordings and hundreds of video features. The initiative provides unparalleled accessibility to less-often heard voices of people from all over the world. \r\n\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nMoses Ach met Einstein in 1940, who encouraged him to record and document the sounds in the world.\r\n",
