This is part of a 'composition' written by the composer James Saunders. When this piece is performed, each person uses a set of strict instructions about when and how they should move their cup.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The composer, James Saunders, says: 'I am interested in the way ordinary objects can be used to make sounds. There are so many amazing ways to draw sounds out of the things we find around us, and in some of my pieces I try to use everyday items as instruments. In this piece, the ten performers each have a cardboard coffee cup, the kind you get with a takeaway coffee (but empty, and dry!). They also each have to find five different surfaces. These could be anything flat, such as a piece of wood, some felt, a brick, a metal baking tray, and so on.' 'All of the fifty surfaces should be different in some way: this is quite hard to achieve. In the piece, the players are all given stopwatches and have specific times at which they push their cups across the surfaces. They are instructed variously to drag, push, or circle the cups, and are told which way up to hold the cup. This results in many different friction sounds which start and stop, a bit like a machine, with different combinations being created. All of the sounds have a lot of inner detail.'[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The title comes from the idea that different textures on the surfaces they choose affect the sound you hear.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Can you think of 5 surfaces you might use if you played this piece?

This piece was written quite recently and is full of repetitive melodic patterns and rhythms. Could you hear the clicking of the keys and pedals as the musician was playing the tune?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Now that we have electronic keyboards, harmoniums are not used nearly as much.","r":65,"c":"N","y":0},{"t":"s","s":130,"v":"1961/1962","r":65,"c":"T","y":0},{"t":"v","s":132,"v":"43044","r":65,"c":"U","y":164},{"t":"s","s":129,"v":"5 minutes","r":65,"c":"W","y":0},{"t":"s","s":129,"v":"lesson plan, learning activity","r":65,"c":"X","y":0},{"t":"s","s":130,"v":"GRC1 #31 - Kilindini Mujimupia.mp3","r":65,"c":"Y","y":0},{"t":"v","s":133,"v":"4.1666666666666699E-2","r":0,"c":"A","y":20},{"t":"s","s":129,"v":"MP3","r":0,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":134,"v":"TSCD935D","r":0,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":134,"v":"HMS 007","r":0,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":135,"v":"The Sleeping Moustache","r":0,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":134,"v":"Track 9","r":0,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"65","spans":"1:36"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":127,"v":"GRC1 #46","r":66,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":128,"v":"Mouth Music","r":66,"c":"B","y":0},{"t":"s","s":127,"v":"Collection 1","r":66,"c":"C","y":0},{"t":"s","s":129,"v":"Brian Irvine","r":66,"c":"D","y":0},{"t":"s","s":130,"v":"5304KB","r":66,"c":"E","y":0},{"t":"s","s":130,"v":"y","r":66,"c":"I","y":0},{"t":"s","s":131,"v":"When you listened, what did you hear?","r":66,"c":"K","y":0},{"t":"s","s":131,"v":"What do you think made the sound?","r":66,"c":"L","y":0},{"t":"s","s":131,"v":"Was it easy or hard to listen to?","r":66,"c":"M","y":0},{"t":"s","s":130,"v":"You just heard a style of American music called 'Old-Time Music,' or 'Mountain Music.'[BREAKPARAGRAPH]The name 'Old-Time Music' comes from the fact it is one of the oldest types of American music, with roots in British, Scottish and Irish folk music brought to the United States by immigrants from those countries.

The music was performed on a piano.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]What did you think you were listening to? The piano sounds very different to a normal piano because it has been 'prepared'.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Inside every piano, there are hundreds of strings. When the pianist presses down a key on the piano, some of the strings are hit by a hammer inside the instrument, which causes the strings to vibrate and make a sound. This piano has small pieces of rubber, wood and metal squeezed between the strings to make them sound different to a normal piano.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]How many different sounds could you hear coming from this instrument? When John Cage wrote this piece he was influenced by the sound of the gamelan orchestra, which is a set of instruments that people from Indonesia often play.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]A gamelan orchestra has lots of different instruments made from metal that are played by hitting them gently with a stick. Some of the gamelan instruments make a short, high sound but others make a very long deep sound.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]In Cage's piece, the piano plays the same melodic fragment over and over again, almost like the musician is thinking carefully about what they are saying. Did you notice how some of the higher sounds rang out for a long time, but other sounds clicked to a steady pulse throughout? What do you imagine this piece is about?

Different textures are created as the strings and brass sometimes blend together closely, and other times work in separate teams.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Gabrieli composed using a style known as 'call and response' (or antiphony), where two groups play similar music one after another, almost like a conversation between two friends.

It also has lots of buttons on each end to make the sounds higher or lower.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you hear the click-clack of the buttons being pressed, or the rustling, whooshing sound of the melodeon being squashed and stretched by the musician?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Did you also hear the tapping of feet against the floor? These sounds came from a dancer who was performing something called a \"step dance\". Did you notice how all of his footsteps created a rhythm that was in time with the sound of the melodeon? It was almost as though the tapping of his feet was a drum playing along as part of the music, as well as a dance.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This minute was recorded in Suffolk where everyone was having a party! Did you hear the sound of people chattering and clapping in the background, or the creaky opening and closing of doors? What kind of place did you imagine when you listened - did it sound like a fun place to be? Visit the English Folk Dance and Song Society's online Resource Bank.

The keys cause small, soft hammers to hit strings inside the instrument, making them vibrate. All the strings are different lengths, so they each vibrate differently, and make sounds of different pitches.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]Because the piano has lots of strings, it echoes whenever one is hit or plucked. Did you hear the clicks and splutters from inside the piano as the different strings all joined in?[BREAKPARAGRAPH]In this minute, the musician was creating unusual timbres by playing inside the piano, which means that, rather than pressing the keys, they were plucking and hitting the strings with their hands!

When he played very quickly, all of the sounds were jumbled up - there were twanging sounds, clicks and pops, and loud scraping noises, all squeezed together.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]At other times, he left more space between sounds, making room for delicate high notes to jump out, or for the strong low strings on the guitar to vibrate.[BREAKPARAGRAPH]This music is partly improvised, which means that the musician composes some of the music whilst they are playing.

The project receives no external funding with all audio files being published under a creative commons (non-commercial) licence.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of metadata with nearly all the sound files has made the London Sound Survey's material useful to postgraduate researchers working in fields such as geography and auditory perception. \r\n\r\nA sense of history is provided through written testimonials.

The label believed that music could be used as a tool for cultural and educational revolution and that folk music passed down the generations gave a voice to the people.\r\n\r\nThe first title in Topic Record’s catalogue was “The Man That Waters Down The Beer” by Paddy Ryan. As well as aiming to present British industrial and urban folksong, they played an important role in disseminating the work of American folk singers such as Paul Robeson and Woody Guthrie.\r\n\r\nThroughout the 50s and 60s their reputation became firmly established and a blossoming audience for folk music surfaced.\r\n\r\nNotable performers who recorded for Topic include The Spinners, Vanessa Redgrave, Jeannie Robertson and The Watersons. However the label was not exclusively focused on British and American Music, and also released collections from Bulgaria, Albania, Greece and Turkey.\r\n\r\nCurrent director Tony Engle oversaw a rich period of releases by seminal artists in the 70s including Martin Carthy, widely acknowledged to have influenced the work of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon and one of the forerunners of the contemporary folk revival.\r\nIn recent years Topic has continued to release new recordings as well as reissuing the very best of its back catalogue, including a 20 volume anthology of traditional music from the UK entitled The Voice of The People .\r\n\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nIn the labels early days some of their releases were on 8inch vinyl rather than the more usual 12inch.

J.\" Cole is Britain’s pre-eminent pedal steel guitarist.

This demonstrated what Cole and the steel guitar were capable of, creating a context for the instrument in other artists’ work.\r\n\r\nThroughout his career he has been in constant demand as a session musician appearing with artists such as Roger Daltry, Procul Harem, Joan Armatrading, Cat Stevens, The Walker Brothers, Paul Young and The Stranglers amongst many others.\r\n\r\nHe continues to work with high profile and more experimental artists including Bjork, The Orb, Spiritualised, Robbie Williams and Brian Eno.\r\nHis solo work has always been experimental, and involves working as a performer as well as a writer, arranger, mixer and producer.\r\n\r\nCole has pioneered the use of the pedal steel outside of American Country music where he feels he is pushing boundaries in bringing the exotic, yearning sound to unfamiliar contexts. A shared passion for exotica and drum ‘n’ bass culminated in ‘Stop the Panic’ an electronica album with Luke Vibert and later on 2004’s ‘Trouble in Paradise’ including appearances by Groove Armada and Alabama 3.\r\n\r\nFun Fact \r\nNever content to stand still, BJ now makes his unique sound palette available to recording artists, songwriters and record producers via his 'Online Overdub Service', which he has set up as an economical and speedy way to get his Pedal Steel on to your recordings via the internet. \r\n","r":37,"c":"J","y":0}],"r":"37","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"David Bedford","r":38,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"38","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"David Lumsdaine","r":39,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"39","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"David Mowatt","r":40,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"40","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":66,"v":"30 second taster","r":41,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":66,"v":"Sheffield, UK","r":41,"c":"B","y":0},{"t":"s","s":64,"v":"http://chriswatson.net/","r":41,"c":"C","y":0},{"t":"s","s":61,"v":"Italy","r":41,"c":"E","y":0},{"t":"s","s":61,"v":"British","r":41,"c":"F","y":0},{"t":"v","s":61,"v":"1912","r":41,"c":"G","y":0},{"t":"v","s":61,"v":"2013","r":41,"c":"H","y":0}],"r":"41","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"Dolly Curtis and Charlie Whiting ","r":42,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"42","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":66,"v":"Duncan Chapman","r":43,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":61,"v":"Daphne","r":43,"c":"B","y":0},{"t":"s","s":64,"v":"Oram","r":43,"c":"C","y":0},{"t":"s","s":93,"v":"Italy","r":43,"c":"E","y":0},{"t":"s","s":93,"v":"British","r":43,"c":"F","y":0},{"t":"s","s":62,"v":"http://daphneoram.org","r":43,"c":"I","y":0},{"t":"s","s":71,"v":"Barney Strachan is an artist, musician and producer working across a broad range of musical styles, including composing using environmental sounds.\r\nBarney Strachan’s work has been commissioned by Fife, Edinburgh and Dundee Councils, as well as by other arts groups and bodies including the RSPB and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, to create community-based sound installations and sound related projects.\r\n\r\nHe has also collaborated on projects with dance and theatre companies across the UK, Sweden, Australia and South Korea.\r\n\r\nAs a commercial musician he has toured across the UK, Holland and the US with various bands.

However his real love was sailing, both for work and pleasure, and he went on two long sea voyages complete with ship’s cat and melodeon before leaving the newspaper to work as a mate, and then a skipper on a Thames sailing barge.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1960’s he ran the Cambria sailing boat as an owner-skipper before replacing it with a small motor coaster which he used to carry china clay, coke, soya beans and scrap metal around the UK and over to Europe.\r\n\r\nHe moved to the Isle of Wight with his wife Toni in the 1970’s and recorded his last two albums.\r\nWorking as a bargeman allowed Roberts to collect songs from bargemen and others he met along the East Anglian coast, which he added to his repertoire of his own songs. During this time he carried on writing to supplement his income with books and articles.\r\n\r\nHe had amassed quite a repertoire of songs by the 1950s and gained a reputation as a great singer and storyteller, respected by musicians and bargemen alike.

His early compositions were small arrangements, romances and chamber pieces.\r\n\r\nHe turned his back on a career in medicine to follow his passion for music, and went on to compose works that showcased the innovativeness and search for expression that were hallmarks of Romanticism. \r\n\r\nBerlioz had a romantic soul and a great affection for literature, particularly the writing of Thomas de Quincy, Goethe, Byron and Shakespeare - who inspired many of his best-known works.

He is regarded as one of the most important and influential musical figures of all time. \r\n\r\nBeethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age as a child prodigy. He moved to Vienna (where he lived until his death) at the age of 21 and studied composition under Joseph Haydn, gaining a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. His long-term benefactor Count Waldstein suggested in his farewell letter to Beethoven that through Haydn’s hands and diligent hard work he would receive the spirit of Mozart who along with Beethoven’s father had recently passed away. Clearly this had an effect, as the work from this period is distinctly Mozartean in character.\r\n\r\nHis best-known compositions include 9 symphonies, 5 piano concertos, 1 violin concerto, 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, his great Missa solemnis, and one opera, Fidelio.\r\nHe was the first composer to use a choir in a symphony, in the last movement of his famous Ninth Symphony where he set the words of Friedrich von Schiller as an ‘Ode to Joy’. Nowadays this is well known as the European anthem.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that his immediate predecessors Mozart and Haydn had an influence on Beethoven. However Beethoven’s melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart. Building on their example Beethoven continually strove to stretch the bounds of music to new limits. \r\nEach of his nine symphonies is completely different from any previous one, and he showed similar originality in every major genre of the time. He achieved his goal through a combination of natural genius and sheer hard work: every one of his major compositions is the result of painstaking refinement, evident in the many thousands of pages of musical sketches that he wrote.\r\nThe quality of his music has ensured his lasting reputation. Its combination of beauty and unpredictability, extreme emotional depth and intellectual rigour, across so many genres, is regarded as unsurpassed.\r\nFun Fact\r\nMany of Beethovens most admired works were created in the last 15 years of his life when he was almost completely deaf.\r\n","r":125,"c":"J","y":0}],"r":"125","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"Patti Langton","r":126,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"126","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":58,"v":"Ensemble SPOK","r":127,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":90,"v":"Osvaldo","r":127,"c":"B","y":0},{"t":"s","s":98,"v":"Coluccino ","r":127,"c":"C","y":0},{"t":"s","s":67,"v":"Belize, USA, England","r":127,"c":"J","y":0}],"r":"127","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"Pauline Oliveros","r":128,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"128","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":64,"v":"Pete Coe","r":129,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"129","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"Peter Edwards","r":130,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"130","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"Peter Wiegold","r":131,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"131","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"Phil Codd","r":132,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"132","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"Philip Venables","r":133,"c":"A","y":0}],"r":"133","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":63,"v":"Pierre Schaeffer","r":134,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":61,"v":"Domodossola","r":134,"c":"B","y":0},{"t":"s","s":64,"v":"Italian","r":134,"c":"C","y":0},{"t":"s","s":61,"v":"http://osvaldocoluccino.blogspot.co.uk/","r":134,"c":"E","y":0},{"t":"s","s":61,"v":"Geórgos","r":134,"c":"F","y":0},{"t":"v","s":61,"v":"1910","r":134,"c":"G","y":0},{"t":"v","s":61,"v":"1995","r":134,"c":"H","y":0}],"r":"134","spans":"1:11"},{"cells":[{"t":"s","s":71,"v":"Traditional, arranged by Sally Davies","r":135,"c":"A","y":0},{"t":"s","s":64,"v":"Paul","r":135,"c":"B","y":0},{"t":"s","s":66,"v":"Duck","r":135,"c":"C","y":0},{"t":"s","s":93,"v":"Italy","r":135,"c":"E","y":0},{"t":"s","s":93,"v":"British","r":135,"c":"F","y":0},{"t":"s","s":62,"v":"Pierre","r":135,"c":"I","y":0},{"t":"s","s":71,"v":"Marion Sumner (known as the“Fiddle King of The South”) was an influential musician from Florida who played with flair and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nRaised in Vicco, Kentucky, Marion Sumner learned to play the violin as a child and became something of a prodigy.
